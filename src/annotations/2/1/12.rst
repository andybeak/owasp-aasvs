Note: The goal of allowing the user to view their password or see the last character temporarily is to improve the
usability of credential entry, particularly around the use of longer passwords, passphrases, and password
managers. Another reason for including the requirement is to deter or prevent test reports unnecessarily requiring
organizations to override native platform password field behavior to remove this modern user-friendly security
experience.
