Are IFRAME elements used to load in content from external parties (for instance from advertisers)? Can they be subverted to load in a URL from an attacker?
Validate URLs passed to XMLHttpRequest.open, current browsers allow these URLs to be cross domain and this behavior can lead to code injection by a remote attacker. Pay extra attention to absolute URLs.
